    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <div class="welcome-section">
      <div class="welcome-text">
          <p>I am a Business Intelligence and Financial Analysis professional with a strong academic foundation in Finance and Computer Information Systems, holding a B.S. in Business Administration from Cal Poly Pomona. My academic career was distinguished by honors recognition and leadership opportunities, including serving as president of the university's student-managed investment fund. As a core member of the team, I helped lead Cal Poly Pomona to win the inaugural first-place award in a CFAOC-sponsored portfolio competition. This experience sharpened my skills in equity research, portfolio construction, and strategic financial analysis.
          </p>

          <p>Before transitioning into finance and business intelligence, I operated a portrait photography business and worked with Sunset School Portraits. These entrepreneurial roles taught me discipline, adaptability, and customer-focused thinking. Today, I bring a creative and analytical perspective to every project, along with a strong commitment to continuous learning and producing meaningful, measurable outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>If you're hiring for a role in financial analysis or business intelligence, I'd love to share more about how I can bring value to your team.</p>

<div class="container" id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>I'm Omar Pelcastre Cabrera, a finance and business intelligence professional with a B.S. in Business
    Administration from Cal Poly Pomona, concentrating in Finance and Computer Information Systems. During my time at
    the university, I served as president of the student-managed investment fund, where I was part of the team led a
    group of talented individuals to a first-place finish in a CFAOC-sponsored portfolio competition. These
    experiences gave me hands-on exposure to equity research, financial strategy, and data analytics&mdash;foundations
    I continue to build on today.</p>
  <p>Before I was authorized to work legally in the U.S., I spent nearly a decade adapting to the constraints of
    undocumented status. I pursued photography out of both necessity and creativity&mdash;eventually running my own
    business and contracting with studios to support myself and my family. During the pandemic, I transitioned to gig
    work, where I developed custom tools to track and forecast my income. These moments shaped my mindset:
    resourceful, flexible, and grounded in real-world problem-solving. I later joined Sunset School Portraits, a role
    that allowed me to work while caring for my young son.</p>
  <p>My technical strengths lie in financial research, equity analysis, and data-driven modeling using Python and
    Excel. I continue to sharpen these skills through personal projects and ongoing education. My goal is to apply
    this technical foundation&mdash;and the resilience of my journey&mdash;to a team that values strategic thinking,
    adaptability, and meaningful impact. What drives me most is the ability to keep learning while supporting my
    family. I'm most fulfilled when we're together outdoors, discovering something new. I strive to be a great example
    for my son and a loving husband to my wife, and I define success as doing meaningful work with purpose while
    providing for those I love.</p>
